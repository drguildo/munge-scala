Improvements
------------
 * Limit the number of concurrent downloads.
 * Separate out duplicate functionality such as the pop-up menus and model
   manipulations.

Ideas
-----
 * A column with the status code of the URL. The text could be colour coded.
 * A generic way to download media embedded/linked in a page
 * A tab/set of tabs for parsing URLs on specific sites (e.g. to extract Flash
   videos from them)
 * A way to generate directory names
 * A way to rename files (i.e. to deal with 01.jpg type bullshit)
 * A way to search Google Images and potentially other image/file search engines
 * Store download list across sessions.
